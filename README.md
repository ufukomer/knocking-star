# Knocking Star

Knocking Star is a portfolio and blogging site that's created with various technologies:

 - Spring Boot
 - Polymer
 - Gradle
 - Bower
  
### Compatibility
Since the web components are not supported by all browsers this content is fully compatible with only Opera and Chrome. Although, with a little hack you can make it compatible with Firefox. Check the status from [here](http://jonrimmer.github.io/are-we-componentized-yet/).

### Issues 
This site isn't working dynamically for now. Because Neon-animated-pages doesn't satisfy needs. After adding more than two posts, to the page 'Posts', Neon-animated-pages doesn't resize thus the footer overlaps the content. Therefore, I don't recommend you to use this site as a template site without fixing issues -but it would be okay to use if you replace Neon-animated-pages with Iron-pages. Although, that might require changing most part of the CSS code.

### Contributing
Feel free to open a pull request that fixes issues or improve my code somehow.

### Usage
 - Run ```gradle build``` command or ```./gradlew build``` if you don't have gradle installed in your system to build the project and install bower dependencies. 
 - Replace [database configuration](https://github.com/ufukomer/knocking-star/blob/master/src/main/resources/application.properties) with yours.
 - Run ```gradle bootRun``` command to start web services and database connection.
